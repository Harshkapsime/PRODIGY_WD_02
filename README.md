⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application
Hi there! 👋
This is a simple and user-friendly Stopwatch Web Application I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, pause, reset, and track lap times easily, with a clean and responsive design.

This project was part of my Task-02 submission during my internship at Prodigy Infotech.

 Features
✅ Start / Stop / Pause the stopwatch
✅ Reset the timer
✅ Lap time tracking (optional feature if you’ve added it)
✅ Clean and easy-to-use interface
✅ Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens
✅ No external libraries—just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 → Page structure and layout
CSS3 → Styling and responsive design
JavaScript (Vanilla) → Timer logic and user interaction handling

✨ What I Learned
Implemented JavaScript timing functions like setInterval() and clearInterval()
Improved DOM manipulation skills
Practiced creating responsive web pages using Flexbox and media queries
Focused on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code
